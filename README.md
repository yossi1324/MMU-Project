# MMU Project
My MMU project , Java course
## Creating the computer's MMU unit as a software:
Writing generic cache replacement algorithms and import them as jars to the project.

Simulate RAM, Hard disk and MMU work when page-fault or page-replacements accurse.

Using multi-threaded environment as each created thread acts like a process cycle asking for pages, some threads are used for running CLI, GUI, server and client's request.

Java Swing use for creating a GUI.

Server & Client communications.

**In general: working with JSON files, java containers, threads & executor, MVC model, jars and UNIT testing.**
